# Sample Repository Layout

All pages are saved as `index.html` files, which pretty much every web server on the planet will serve by default. Meaning, if this project were posted to `example.com`, the home page would be accessible from `http://example.com/` -- it would be unnecessary to type the `index.html` part afterward.

Similarly, the About page could be reached from `http://example.com/about/`.

Look at the repo to understand the layout of its files and directories (folders). The basic structure is also representable this way:

    ./
    ├── about
    │   └── index.html
    ├── resume
    │   └── index.html
    ├── .htmllintrc
    ├── README.md
    └── index.html
